Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture.,Informative,"If it's a cultural issue then they should teach about the N-word only in history classes. Otherwise, it's just another excuse to justify racism.",2,2,2,2,1

The drug trade is full of Black people who are breaking the law.,Informative,The majority of the people arrested for drug smuggling are poor. Those arrested for crime in general are not generally poor. Maybe this phenomenon has to do more with poverty than with the colour of their skin.,3,3,2,2,2

The goverment is making law exclusively for black people.

The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination,Informative,"Nowhere does the Bible actually oppose homosexuality per se. In the Old Testament the prohibition of homosexuality and of heterosexuality go together in view of ritual purity.

Homosexuality is found only in few passages of the New Testament and with very debatable interpretations.",3,4,2,4,3
The Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination,Questioning,"The Bible has many different teachings on homosexuality and faith. Did you know that the Bible does not speak about the democratic society, in which we are living in mutual acceptance? What do you have to say about that?",3,3,3,2,2

"Faggots are sexual abuser of children. These animals should be put out of their misery, condemned to death.",Informative,"Although the line 'These animals should be put out of their misery, condemned to death' is horrific, it is a lament that could have been used in favour of ensuring that those who are vulnerable to abuse due to their gender identity or sexual inclinations have access to safe houses, protection, and a good life.",3,3,2,3,2

Obama should have been impeached. Niggers are the cause of the corruption in the government.,Informative,"While race cannot be a contributing factor to impeachment, corruption may be. Still it does not automatically make a president illegitimate. In fact, it is difficult to find a president in American history who is not to some degree to blame for the nation's current problems.

They are a moral failing for our society.",Informative,"Ah, so you think women are fundamentally incapable of forming conscious or morally complex opinions.

If only we followed the teachings of our fathers instead!",Informative,"In the West, this is still the prevailing mindset, men are superior and must therefore take charge and ""man up"". However, this is just a patriarchal heritage imposing a pressure on both men and women to be something different from just themselves, and should therefore be abandoned.",3,3,3,3,3
"My ex told me I needed to change, she's a harlot just as all women.",Informative,"Females as targets of violence and hate must be taken seriously, since there are many such cases of abuse being reported: name-calling such as ""slut"" is a violent crime.

Feminism is about the aspiration for female power and the end of patriarchy. This is the death of the Western World.,Informative,"Patriarchy is a system of social domination based on hierarchical groupings made according to one's sex.
